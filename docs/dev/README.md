# Internal Development Documentation

> **Path**: `docs/dev/`
> **Parent**: [docs/](../README.md)

Internal documentation for contributors: research, benchmarks, workflows, and exploration.

**Note:** For product documentation, see the parent [docs/](../README.md). For design decisions, see [rfcs/](../rfcs/).

## Contents

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [benchmarks/](./benchmarks/) | Performance benchmarks and profiling guides |
| [optimizations/](./optimizations/) | Performance optimization research and implementations |
| [integrations/](./integrations/) | Future integration exploration (ML, observability, etc.) |
| [research/](./research/) | Architecture reviews and design exploration |
| [workflows/](./workflows/) | Development workflows and tooling guides |

## Meta Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [FEATURE-OVERVIEW.md](./FEATURE-OVERVIEW.md) | Comprehensive feature inventory |
| [LLM-CONTEXT.md](./LLM-CONTEXT.md) | Ultra-condensed context for LLMs |
| [TODO-docs-audit.md](./TODO-docs-audit.md) | Pending documentation fixes |

## Purpose

This directory contains **internal development documentation** — content useful for contributors but not part of the product documentation:

- **Research** — Exploration of potential features, architecture reviews
- **Benchmarks** — Performance tracking and regression testing
- **Optimizations** — Implementation notes for performance improvements
- **Workflows** — Development processes (testing, debugging, etc.)

Content here may be outdated, experimental, or historical. The main `docs/` tree is the authoritative product documentation.
