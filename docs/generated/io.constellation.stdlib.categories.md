### trait HigherOrderFunctions

/** Higher-order functions for list processing in the standard library.
  *
  * These functions accept lambda expressions and are processed specially by the compiler. The
  * runtime execution is handled via InlineTransform (FilterTransform, MapTransform, etc.) rather
  * than traditional Module implementations.
  *
  * Usage in constellation-lang:
  * {{{
  * use stdlib.collection
  *
  * in numbers: List<Int>
  *
  * positives = filter(numbers, (x) => x > 0)
  * doubled = map(numbers, (x) => x * 2)
  * allPositive = all(numbers, (x) => x > 0)
  * anyNegative = any(numbers, (x) => x < 0)
  * }}}
