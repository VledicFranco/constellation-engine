## Classes

### class BidirectionalTypeChecker

/** Bidirectional type checker for constellation-lang.
  *
  * Implements the bidirectional typing algorithm where types flow both:
  *   - Bottom-up (inference/synthesis mode ⇑): type derived from expression structure
  *   - Top-down (checking mode ⇓): expected type pushed into expression
  *
  * Key benefits:
  *   - Lambda parameters can be inferred from function context
  *   - Empty lists can be typed from expected context
  *   - Better error messages with contextual information
  *
  * The core rules are:
  * {{{
  * [Sub]        Γ ⊢ e ⇒ A    A <: B
  *              ─────────────────────
  *              Γ ⊢ e ⇐ B
  *
  * [Lam-Check]  Γ, x:A ⊢ e ⇐ B
  *              ─────────────────────
  *              Γ ⊢ (λx. e) ⇐ A → B
  *
  * [App]        Γ ⊢ f ⇒ A → B    Γ ⊢ arg ⇐ A
  *              ─────────────────────────────
  *              Γ ⊢ f(arg) ⇒ B

### trait Mode

/** Type checking mode for bidirectional type inference.
  *
  * Bidirectional type checking operates in two modes:
  *   - Inference (⇑): Synthesize a type from the expression structure (bottom-up)
  *   - Checking (⇓): Verify expression against an expected type (top-down)
  *
  * The key insight is that expected type information flows down into expressions, enabling type
  * inference for constructs that would otherwise need annotations.
  *
  * @see
  *   "Bidirectional Typing" by Dunfield & Krishnaswami (2021)
  * @see
  *   "Complete and Easy Bidirectional Typechecking" by Dunfield & Pfenning (2013)
