## Objects

### ConstellationParser$

**Methods:**

| Method | Signature | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `parse` | `(source: String): Either[ParseError, Pipeline]` | /** Parse a constellation-lang pipeline. Clears the memoization cache before parsing to ensure |
| `toString` | `(): String` | /** Returns a string representation of the object. |
| `getClass` | `[X0](): Class[Any]` | /** Returns the runtime class representation of the object. |
| `!=` | `(x$0: Any): Boolean` | /** Test two objects for inequality. |
| `notifyAll` | `(): Unit` | /** Wakes up all threads that are waiting on the receiver object's monitor. |
| `notify` | `(): Unit` | /** Wakes up a single thread that is waiting on the receiver object's monitor. |
| `eq` | `(x$0: Object): Boolean` | /** Tests whether the argument (`that`) is a reference to the receiver object (`this`). |
| `==` | `(x$0: Any): Boolean` | /** Test two objects for equality. |
| `equals` | `(x$0: Any): Boolean` | /** Compares the receiver object (`this`) with the argument object (`that`) for equivalence. |
| `hashCode` | `(): Int` | /** Calculate a hash code value for the object. |
| `isInstanceOf` | `[X0](): Boolean` | /** Test whether the dynamic type of the receiver object is `T0`. |
| `asInstanceOf` | `[X0](): Any` | /** Cast the receiver object to be of type `T0`. |
| `wait` | `(x$0: Long, x$1: Int): Unit` | /** See [[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#wait-long-int-]] |
| `wait` | `(x$0: Long): Unit` | /** See [[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#wait-long-]]. |

| `synchronized` | `[X0](x$0: X0): Any` | /** Executes the code in `body` with an exclusive lock on `this`. |
| `ne` | `(x$0: Object): Boolean` | /** Equivalent to `!(this eq that)`. |
| `##` | `(): Int` | /** Equivalent to `x.hashCode` except for boxed numeric types and `null`. |

### ParserOptimizations$

/** Parser optimization utilities for cats-parse.
  *
  * Note: cats-parse has a sealed Parser type with Parser vs Parser0 distinction. The most effective
  * optimizations are:
  *   1. Use P.oneOf instead of chained | for alternatives 2. Use .backtrack only where needed 3.
  *      Order alternatives by likelihood (most common first) 4. Use P.charIn/P.stringIn for simple
  *      character-based choices

**Methods:**

| Method | Signature | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `oneOfOptimized` | `[A](alternatives: List[Parser[A]]): Parser[Any]` | /** Create an optimized choice from a list of alternatives. Uses P.oneOf which is more efficient |
| `getClass` | `[X0](): Class[Any]` | /** Returns the runtime class representation of the object. |
| `!=` | `(x$0: Any): Boolean` | /** Test two objects for inequality. |
| `notifyAll` | `(): Unit` | /** Wakes up all threads that are waiting on the receiver object's monitor. |
| `equals` | `(x$0: Any): Boolean` | /** Compares the receiver object (`this`) with the argument object (`that`) for equivalence. |

| `toString` | `(): String` | /** Returns a string representation of the object. |
| `notify` | `(): Unit` | /** Wakes up a single thread that is waiting on the receiver object's monitor. |
| `eq` | `(x$0: Object): Boolean` | /** Tests whether the argument (`that`) is a reference to the receiver object (`this`). |
| `==` | `(x$0: Any): Boolean` | /** Test two objects for equality. |
| `oneOfWithBacktrack` | `[A](alternatives: List[Parser[A]]): Parser[Any]` | /** Create an optimized choice with backtracking on all alternatives. Use when any alternative |
| `hashCode` | `(): Int` | /** Calculate a hash code value for the object. |
| `asInstanceOf` | `[X0](): Any` | /** Cast the receiver object to be of type `T0`. |
| `isInstanceOf` | `[X0](): Boolean` | /** Test whether the dynamic type of the receiver object is `T0`. |
| `synchronized` | `[X0](x$0: X0): Any` | /** Executes the code in `body` with an exclusive lock on `this`. |
| `ne` | `(x$0: Object): Boolean` | /** Equivalent to `!(this eq that)`. |
| `##` | `(): Int` | /** Equivalent to `x.hashCode` except for boxed numeric types and `null`. |

## Traits

### trait MemoizationSupport

/** Memoization support for the Constellation parser.
  *
  * Provides caching utilities for expensive parsing operations. Uses ThreadLocal storage for
  * thread-safety in concurrent parsing scenarios.
  *
  * Note: cats-parse Parser is sealed and cannot be extended directly. This trait provides
  * memoization at the source-string level for repeated parsing of the same expressions.
