## Classes

### case class AuthConfig

/** Configuration for static API-key authentication.
  *
  * When `hashedKeys` is non-empty, every request that does not match a public path must carry an
  * `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header that verifies against a hashed key.
  *
  * Environment variable:
  *   - `CONSTELLATION_API_KEYS` — comma-separated `key:Role` pairs, e.g. `key1:Admin,key2:Execute`
  *
  * Keys are hashed with SHA-256 on startup to prevent:
  *   - Exposure in memory dumps
  *   - Accidental logging
  *   - Timing attacks (constant-time verification)
  *
  * @param hashedKeys
  *   List of hashed API keys with their roles
  * @param publicPaths
  *   Path prefixes that bypass authentication (prefix match)
