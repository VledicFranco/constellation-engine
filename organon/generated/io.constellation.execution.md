  * that should be recomputed, consider using a cache with TTL.

### class TokenBucketRateLimiter

/** Token bucket rate limiter.
  *
  * Implements the token bucket algorithm for smooth rate limiting:
  *   - Tokens are added at a fixed rate (rate.count / rate.perDuration)
  *   - Each operation consumes one token
  *   - If no tokens available, caller waits until token is available
  *
  * ==Usage==
  *
  * {{{
  * val limiter = TokenBucketRateLimiter(RateLimit.perSecond(10))
  *
  * // Acquire before executing rate-limited operation
  * limiter.acquire >> myOperation
  *
  * // Or use withRateLimit for automatic handling
  * limiter.withRateLimit(myOperation)
  * }}}
  *
  * ==Thread Safety==
  *
  * This implementation is thread-safe and suitable for concurrent access. Multiple fibers can
  * safely call acquire concurrently.

### trait PriorityLevel

/** Priority levels for task scheduling.
  *
  * Higher values indicate higher priority:
  *   - Critical (100): System-critical tasks
  *   - High (75): User-facing, latency-sensitive
  *   - Normal (50): Default priority
  *   - Low (25): Background processing
  *   - Background (0): Best-effort, lowest priority
  *   - Custom(n): User-defined priority value
