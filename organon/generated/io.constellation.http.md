### RateLimitMiddleware$

/** Per-IP and per-API-key token-bucket rate limiter for HTTP routes.
  *
  * Uses `tryAcquire` (non-blocking). When a client exceeds the limit a 429 response is returned
  * immediately with a `Retry-After` header.
  *
  * Rate limiting is applied in two layers:
  *   1. Per-IP: every client is rate-limited by source IP 2. Per-API-key: authenticated clients are
  *      also rate-limited by their key
  *
  * A request must pass both checks. This prevents a single API key from monopolizing the IP's
  * budget and vice versa.
