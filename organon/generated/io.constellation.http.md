### RateLimitMiddleware$

/** Per-IP and per-API-key token-bucket rate limiter for HTTP routes.
  *
  * Uses `tryAcquire` (non-blocking). When a client exceeds the limit a 429 response is returned
  * immediately with a `Retry-After` header.
  *
  * Rate limiting is applied in two layers:
  *   1. Per-IP: every client is rate-limited by source IP 2. Per-API-key: authenticated clients are
  *      also rate-limited by their key
  *
  * A request must pass both checks. This prevents a single API key from monopolizing the IP's
  * budget and vice versa.

### trait PipelineVersionStore

/** In-memory store that tracks version history for named pipelines.
  *
  * Each call to [[recordVersion]] auto-increments the version number and sets the new version as
  * active. Old versions are retained so callers can list history and roll back.
  */

**Extends:** Object

**Methods:**

| Method | Signature | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `recordVersion` | `(name: String, structuralHash: String, source: Option[String]): IO[PipelineVersion]` | /** Record a new version for a named pipeline. |

| `getClass` | `[X0](): Class[Any]` | /** Returns the runtime class representation of the object. |
| `!=` | `(x$0: Any): Boolean` | /** Test two objects for inequality. |
| `getVersion` | `(name: String, version: Int): IO[Option[PipelineVersion]]` | /** Get a specific version entry. */ |
| `==` | `(x$0: Any): Boolean` | /** Test two objects for equality. |
| `equals` | `(x$0: Any): Boolean` | /** Compares the receiver object (`this`) with the argument object (`that`) for equivalence. |
| `previousVersion` | `(name: String): IO[Option[PipelineVersion]]` | /** Get the version just before the currently active one (for quick rollback). */ |
