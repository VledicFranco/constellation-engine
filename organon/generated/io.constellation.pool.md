## Classes

### class DeferredPool

/** A pool of pre-allocated Deferred instances for reducing allocation overhead.
  *
  * Deferreds in Cats Effect are one-shot: once completed, they cannot be reset. This pool manages a
  * supply of fresh, uncompleted Deferreds that can be acquired for DAG execution. After execution
  * completes, the pool replenishes itself with fresh Deferreds for subsequent requests.
  *
  * ==Thread Safety==
  *
  * All operations are thread-safe and use Cats Effect's Ref for state management.
  *
  * ==Memory Model==
  *
  * The pool maintains between `initialSize` and `maxSize` Deferreds. When depleted, it creates
  * fresh Deferreds on demand. After execution, calling `replenish` restores the pool to its target
  * size.
  *
  * @param initialSize
  *   Number of Deferreds to pre-allocate on initialization
  * @param maxSize
  *   Maximum pool size (to prevent unbounded growth)

### class RuntimePool

/** Unified pool manager for runtime resources.

  * Combines DeferredPool and RuntimeStatePool into a single interface for convenient access and

  *
  * {{{
  * // Create pool manager
  * val pool = RuntimePool.create().unsafeRunSync()

  * // Use in Runtime.runPooled
  * Runtime.runPooled(dagSpec, inputs, modules, pool)

  *
  * Pool sizes can be configured based on workload:
  *   - High throughput: Larger pools (more pre-allocation)
  *   - Low memory: Smaller pools (on-demand allocation)

### class RuntimeStatePool

/** A pool of reusable runtime state containers.

  * Each execution of a DAG requires mutable state to track module status and data values. This pool
  * maintains pre-allocated containers that can be acquired, used for execution, and then released
  * back to the pool.
  *
  * ==Thread Safety==
  *
  * Pool access is thread-safe via Cats Effect Ref. Each acquired PooledState is exclusively owned
  * by its execution and should not be shared.
  *
  * ==Lifecycle==
  *
  *   1. `acquire` - Get a state container from the pool (or create new if empty) 2. Use the
  *      container during DAG execution 3. `release` - Clear and return the container to the pool
  *
  * @param maxSize
  *   Maximum number of state containers to keep in the pool
