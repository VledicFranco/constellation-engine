# Complex Example: Data Analysis Pipeline
# Demonstrates a multi-step data processing workflow with branching

in numbers: List<Int>
in threshold: Int
in multiplier: Int

# Step 1: Filter - keep only numbers above threshold
filtered = FilterGreaterThan(numbers, threshold)

# Step 2: Transform - multiply each filtered number
scaled = MultiplyEach(filtered, multiplier)

# Step 3: Aggregate - calculate statistics on the scaled data
total = SumList(scaled)
avg = Average(scaled)
highest = Max(scaled)
lowest = Min(scaled)

# Step 4: Format - make the total human-readable
formattedTotal = FormatNumber(total)

# Outputs - multiple results from the pipeline
out filtered
out scaled
out total
out avg
out highest
out lowest
out formattedTotal
