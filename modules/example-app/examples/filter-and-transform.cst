# Filter and Transform Pipeline
# Shows how to combine filtering and transformation

# Inputs
in numbers: List<Int>
in threshold: Int
in multiplier: Int

# Filter numbers greater than threshold
filtered = FilterGreaterThan(numbers, threshold)

# Multiply each remaining number
transformed = MultiplyEach(filtered, multiplier)

# Calculate sum of transformed numbers
result = SumList(transformed)

# Output
out result
out filtered
out transformed
