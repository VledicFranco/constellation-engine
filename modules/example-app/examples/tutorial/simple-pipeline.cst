# Define a record type for user data
type User = {
  id: Int,
  name: String,
  email: String,
  score: Int
}

# Input: a single user record
in user: User

# Extract and process fields
user_name = trim(user.name)
is_high_score = gt(user.score, 100)

# Output the results
out user_name
out is_high_score
