# Tutorial Section 4: Type Algebra

# Define record types
type Base = { id: Int, name: String }
type Extra = { name: String, score: Float }

in base: Base
in extra: Extra

# Merge records (right side wins on conflicts)
# Result type: { id: Int, name: String, score: Float }
merged = base + extra

# Project specific fields
# Result type: { id: Int, score: Float }
